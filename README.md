Hi! I'm Thomas Breed, AKA Hendog8, AKA Narwhalosaurus. This is my browser-based, full-stack trivia game, TriviAUGH.

TriviAUGH is a project I started just a few months ago, as I wanted to create a new style of web-based trivia game 
(like Kahoot and its derivatives) for the express purpose of having fun with my friends. It will feature no time-based 
element to its scoring (i.e. players who answer the question entirely correct at 10 seconds left or 0.5 seconds left will 
score the same number of points) to guard against lag when we're inevitably seperated by college, but compensate for that 
loss of incentive to play fast with an incredibly short time per question. It will feature questions that have any number 
of possible correct answers, from 0 to 4, but will score not based solely on how many correct answers you select, but 
how many answers you correctly categorize (that is, every correct answer selected will earn points AND every incorrect 
answer NOT selected will earn points, and categorizing either incorrectly will lose points) to incentivize against simply 
selecting every answer to guarantee you select the correct one(s).

Everything here not automatically created through bootstrapping with React or Node.js or imported as a package is of my own 
creation. This project has not only been a joy to code so far, but has wildly expanded my knowledge of Javascript and HTML, 
and for that I cannot be more grateful. I hope that it, when finished, will give to others (my close friends especially) as 
much as it's given back to me.

Thank you for reading, and please enjoy your tour of the still-in-progress TriviAUGH. Please feel free to check back in 
every few weeks for further updates.

(Please pay the absurdist testing messages and logs no mind. They're simply the easiest way to grab my attention when 
sifting through the stream of logs. Everything'll be much neater by the time TriviAUGH is actually released and housed 
on a permanent site.)
