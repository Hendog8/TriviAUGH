Hi! I'm Thomas Breed, AKA Hendog8, AKA Narwhalosaurus. This is my browser-based full-stack trivia game, TriviAUGH.

TriviAUGH is a project I started just a few months ago, as I wanted to create a new style of web-based trivia game 
(like Kahoot and its derivatives) for the express purpose of having fun with my friends. It will feature no time-based 
element to its scoring (i.e. players who answer the question entirely correct at 10 seconds left or 0.5 seconds left will 
score the same number of points) to guard against lag, but compensate for that loss of incentive to play fast with an 
incredibly short time per question. It will feature questions that have any number of possible correct answers, from 0 
to 4, but will score not based solely on how many correct answers you select, but how many answers you correctly categorize 
(that is, every correct answer selected will earn points AND every incorrect answer NOT selected will earn points, and categorizing 
either incorrectly will lose points) to incentivize against simply selecting every answer to guarantee you select the correct one(s).

Everything here not automatically created through bootstrapping with React or Node.js or imported as a package is of my own creation.
This project has not only been a joy to code, but has wildly expanded my knowledge of Javascript and HTML, and for that 
I cannot be more grateful. I hope this project, when finished, will bring others (my close friends especially) as much 
as it's brought me.
